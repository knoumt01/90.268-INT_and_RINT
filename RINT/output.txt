SEE OUTPUT BELOW (w/ error-causing lines commented):
A test of the RINT class  (2/10/13)


Here are the RINTs x = 0  and y = 4

Here are the ints a = 5 and b = 2


Testing stream input for RINT - enter an int value: Enter integer value : 3

You entered an RINT value of 3

Testing copy ctor
If z is instantiated as y, z = 4  (should be 4)

TESTING BINARY +
If z = x + y and x = 5  and y = 6   then z = 11  (should be 11)
If z = x + 10 and x = 5   then z = 15  (should be 15)
If z = 1 + x and x = 5   then z = 6  (should be 6)

TESTING BINARY -
If z = x - y and x = 24  and y = 30   then z = -6  (should be -6)
If z = x - 10 and x = 24   then z = 14  (should be 14)
If z = 1 - x and x = 24   then z = 23  (should be -23)

TESTING UNARY + -
x = -x  so x now = -1  (should be -1)
x = +x  so x now = -1  (should be -1)
